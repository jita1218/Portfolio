Jita’s Portfolio

Hey! This is the code for my personal portfolio — a small corner of the internet where I show who I am, what I build, and what I’m learning.

✨ What’s Inside?

Nothing too fancy — just:

A clean UI

My skills & experience

A few projects I’ve worked on

Contact section so people can reach out

And my overall vibe as a developer 😄
